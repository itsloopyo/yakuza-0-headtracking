# Yakuza 0 Head Tracking

![Yakuza 0 running with this mod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsloopyo/yakuza-0-headtracking/main/assets/readme-clip.gif)

An unofficial head tracking mod for Yakuza 0 that moves the camera with your head while your mouse or controller keeps control of movement, driven by a webcam, phone, or any OpenTrack compatible tracker, with no VR headset required.

## Features

- **Decoupled look and movement** - your head moves the camera, your mouse and controller work as they always did
- **6DOF tracking** - rotation and positional lean
- **Works with any OpenTrack compatible tracker** - free options available for PC, iOS and Android

## Requirements

- [Yakuza 0 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/), latest patch.
- A head tracking source: [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) with a webcam, VR headset, TrackIR, or a phone tracking app.
- Windows 10/11, 64-bit.

## Installation

### Lopari

Download [Lopari](https://lopari.app), choose **Yakuza 0**, and click
**Play with head tracking**.

### Standalone Installer

1. Download the latest `Yakuza0HeadTracking-vX.Y.Z-installer.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/itsloopyo/yakuza-0-headtracking/releases).
2. Extract it anywhere.
3. Double-click `install.cmd`. It auto-detects your Steam install, places the mod next to `Yakuza0.exe`, and sets up Ultimate ASI Loader if it isn't already present.
4. Configure OpenTrack (or your phone app) to output UDP to `127.0.0.1:4242` (see [Setting Up OpenTrack](#setting-up-opentrack)).
5. Launch the game.

If the installer can't find your game, point it at the install folder yourself, either way works:

```powershell
# Option 1: environment variable
$env:YAKUZA_0_PATH = "D:\Games\Yakuza 0"; .\install.cmd

# Option 2: pass the path directly
.\install.cmd "D:\Games\Yakuza 0"
```

### Manual Installation

For users who prefer to place files by hand:

1. Download [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) (Win64 `dinput8.zip`), extract `dinput8.dll`, rename it to `winmm.dll`, and place it in `media\` next to `Yakuza0.exe`.
2. Place `Yakuza0HeadTracking.asi` (from the installer ZIP's `plugins\` folder) in the same `media\` folder.

Alternatively, the Nexus ZIP (`Yakuza0HeadTracking-vX.Y.Z-nexus.zip`) extracts directly into the game's install folder; it contains only `media\Yakuza0HeadTracking.asi`, so you still need an ASI loader installed.

## Setting Up OpenTrack

The mod listens for OpenTrack pose data on UDP port `4242`, on every network
interface. One datagram is six little-endian 64-bit floats in the order
`x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll`: position in centimetres, rotation in degrees, 48
bytes in total. Anything that sends that to that port drives the view.
OpenTrack's **UDP over network** output sends exactly this, and the steps below
set it up.

1. Install [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases).
2. Pick a tracker under **Input**, using the notes below.
3. Set **Output** to **UDP over network**, host `127.0.0.1`, port `4242`.
4. Press **Start**. Tracking and the game can start in either order.

### Webcam

OpenTrack ships a `neuralnet tracker` input that reads a plain webcam. Select it
under **Input**, pick your camera in its settings, and use the output settings
above. How well it tracks depends on your camera and your lighting, so try it
before buying anything.

### Phone

A phone app can reach the mod directly, with no OpenTrack on the PC, if it sends
the datagram described above. Point it at this PC's IP address (run `ipconfig`
to find it) on port `4242`. Not every phone tracker speaks this protocol, so
check yours for an OpenTrack or UDP output option first. [Headcam](https://headcam.app)
sends it, and I wrote it so decent tracking is free for anyone who already owns
a phone.

Sending direct works when the app filters its own signal on the device. The
mod's smoothing is sized to take the edge off a clean signal rather than to
rescue a noisy one, so a raw feed sent direct will jitter. If it does, point the
app at OpenTrack's **UDP over network** *input* on some other port, say 5252,
and let OpenTrack's filters and curves clean it up before its output forwards to
`127.0.0.1:4242`.

Anything arriving from outside `127.0.0.0/8` counts as a remote connection and
is smoothed with `RemoteSmoothing` rather than `LocalSmoothing`. That includes a
tracker on this very PC that sends to the machine's own LAN address, because the
mod reads the source address and not the machine.

### Headset or other hardware

If your device has an OpenTrack input driver, select it under **Input** and use
the same output settings. OpenTrack's own **Input** list is the authority on
what it can read; the mod only ever sees what OpenTrack sends.

### Centring

Centring belongs to your tracker. The mod subtracts no centre of its own: it
applies the pose it receives exactly as it arrives, so a stream of zeros holds
the view where the game itself puts it. Press the centre control in your tracker
(OpenTrack's **Center** bind, or the CENTER button in Headcam) and the tracker
zeroes its own output, which leaves the view centred with the mod doing nothing.

That is why there is no centre hotkey here and nothing to re-centre in game. Two
centres in series would drift apart, because each side re-centres at moments the
other cannot see, and you would end up pressing twice to centre once. If the
view sits off to one side, centre it in the tracker.

## Controls

Two equivalent binding sets - use whichever your keyboard has. These are the
defaults of the key lists in `CameraUnlock.ini` (see Configuration), where each
key, chords included, can be rebound or removed:

| Action              | Nav-cluster | Chord           |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Toggle tracking     | `End`       | `Ctrl+Shift+Y`  |
| Cycle tracking mode | `Page Up`   | `Ctrl+Shift+G`  |
| Toggle yaw mode     | `Page Down` | `Ctrl+Shift+H`  |

There is no recenter key. The mod applies the pose your tracker sends as-is, so centre it in the tracker app: OpenTrack's Center bind, or the CENTER button in Headcam.

`Page Up` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` cycles tracking mode:

1. Normal head-tracked gameplay
2. Positional tracking disabled, rotational tracking enabled
3. Rotational tracking disabled, positional tracking enabled
4. Back to normal

`Page Down` / `Ctrl+Shift+H` toggles between world-space (horizon-locked) yaw and camera-local yaw.

The tracking mode and the yaw mode are saved to `CameraUnlock.ini` the moment they change, so they come back at the next launch. `End` / `Ctrl+Shift+Y` changes the current session only: tracking starts on or off as `EnableOnStartup` says.

## Configuration

<!-- cameraunlock:config -->
The mod reads its settings from `media\CameraUnlock.ini` in the game folder, and creates the file when it starts and finds none. Edit it with any text editor.

A setting set to `default` takes its value from `Defaults.ini`, which every head tracking mod that keeps its settings in `CameraUnlock.ini` reads. Head tracking mods that keep their settings in another file do not read it. Writing a value in place of `default` changes that setting for this game only. When the mod saves a setting that a hotkey changed in game, it writes the new value in place of `default`, so that setting no longer follows `Defaults.ini` in this game until you set it to `default` again.

`Defaults.ini` is `%AppData%\CameraUnlock\Defaults.ini` on Windows; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` on Linux, or `~/.config/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` where `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, under Wine and Proton too; and `~/Library/Application Support/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` on macOS. The mod's log, where it writes one, names the file it read.

When the mod starts and finds no `Defaults.ini`, it creates one holding the built-in values, unless Windows runs the game as a packaged app. The mod never changes `Defaults.ini` after that. Edit it with any text editor.

The built-in value of each setting set to `default` below:

- `UdpPort=4242`
- `EnableOnStartup=true`
- `WorldSpaceYaw=true`
- `RotationEnabled=true`
- `LocalSmoothing=0.0`
- `RemoteSmoothing=0.15`
- `PositionEnabled=true`
- `PositionLimitX=0.3`
- `PositionLimitY=0.2`
- `PositionLimitYDown=0.2`
- `PositionLimitZ=0.4`
- `PositionLimitZBack=0.1`
- `ToggleKey=End, Ctrl+Shift+Y`
- `CycleTrackingModeKey=PageUp, Ctrl+Shift+G`
- `YawModeKey=PageDown, Ctrl+Shift+H`

With every setting at its default, the file reads:

```ini
; Yakuza 0 head tracking settings.
; Comments start with ; and go on their own line. Text after a value is part of the value.
; Hotkeys are key names such as End, PageUp or Ctrl+Shift+Y. Separate several with commas; leave empty for none.
; A setting set to default takes its value from Defaults.ini, which every head tracking mod
; that keeps its settings in CameraUnlock.ini reads: %AppData%\CameraUnlock\Defaults.ini on
; Windows, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini (normally ~/.config/CameraUnlock) on
; Linux, under Wine and Proton too, and ~/Library/Application Support/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini
; on macOS. The log names the file it read. Write a value instead of default to change that
; setting for this game only.

## Troubleshooting

**Mod not loading:**

- Check for `Yakuza0HeadTracking.log` in `media\` next to `Yakuza0.exe` after launching the game. If it's missing, the ASI loader isn't engaging; re-run `install.cmd`.
- The log is rewritten from scratch on every launch and the launch before it is kept as `Yakuza0HeadTracking.prev.log`, so it is safe to attach as-is. `udp: First UDP packet received` is the line that confirms your tracker's data reached the game.
- Verify both `winmm.dll` and `Yakuza0HeadTracking.asi` are in `media\`.

**No tracking response:**

- Confirm OpenTrack's output is `UDP over network` to `127.0.0.1`, port `4242`, and that OpenTrack is started.
- Make sure only one source is sending to port 4242 (don't run a phone app and OpenTrack at the same time pointing at the same port).
- Tracking may have been toggled off; press `End` (or `Ctrl+Shift+Y`).
- The game pauses when its window loses focus, so keep it focused while testing.

**Jittery / unstable tracking:**

- Enable a smoothing filter in OpenTrack (Accela is the default and works well).
- Wireless phone trackers on congested WiFi can stutter; move closer to the router or switch to a webcam tracker.

**Yaw feels wrong when looking up or down at extreme angles:**

- Try toggling between world-locked and camera-local yaw with `Page Down`. World-locked (default) is horizon-stable; camera-local follows the camera's current up-axis.

## Updating

Download the new release and run `install.cmd` again. Your config is preserved.

## Uninstalling

Run `uninstall.cmd` from the installer ZIP. This removes the mod files and leaves your settings in `media\CameraUnlock.ini`. The ASI loader is only removed if the installer put it there; use `uninstall.cmd /force` to remove it anyway.
